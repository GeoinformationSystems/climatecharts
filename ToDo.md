# Tasks

- Redesign of the user interface to increase usability
  * New menu structure
  * Focus on map and climate chart
- Implementation of additional features
  1. Boxplots for statistical values of temperature and precipation in the previous 30 years
  2. Make obvious that data does not come from points but from a grid
  3. Enable inclusion of new data sources (point data vs. area data, e.g. own weather stations)
  4. Add layers for average temperature / precipation
  5. Compare two climate charts
