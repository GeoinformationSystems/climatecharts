TO DO:
- Boxplots for precipitation: Cherapunji example
- Internal calculation: number of years correct
- Herumklicken und Bug finden
- Show user that data is loading (loading bar or so)
- Chart download option (png, svg)
- Weatehrstations metadata table: cols(temp, prec), rows (miss. months, larg. gap, cov. rate)
- Empty chart title: Default title? Move upwards and reduce height?
- Update climate data from sources (maybe even a script that automates that?)
